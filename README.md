# Cross Street Barbers
The website is built to serve as a web presence for a barbershop. The site features testimonials, an embedded Google Map showing the shop's location, opening times, social media links, a pricelist, contact information, a contact form, and a booking form. 

The site is intended to inform potential customers about the shop's services and to secure customer bookings. The website is designed with this business-to-consumer model in mind.

##UX 
Information must be presented in a clear, straight-forward manner, and keep in mind the overall goal of securing customer bookings. For this reason, it is also important to maintain a simple navigational structure with convenient call-to-action buttons which direct customers to the booking process.
